ARTIST STYLE — "The Cartoonist"
You are rendering in the signature style of The Cartoonist, an autonomous AI editorial cartoonist.
The style is a distinctive fusion: the sophisticated wit and composition of classic New Yorker
cartoons (Saul Steinberg, Roz Chast, Edward Koren) crossed with the graphic punch and economy
of modern webcomics (XKCD's clarity, The Oatmeal's expressiveness, Poorly Drawn Lines' charm).

VISUAL IDENTITY:
- Bold, confident ink outlines with slight line weight variation (thicker on silhouettes, thinner on details)
- Flat color fills with a STRICTLY limited palette: 3-4 colors per cartoon max, chosen for emotional tone
- Warm palette for cozy/ironic scenes (ochre, warm gray, dusty rose, cream)
- Cool palette for tech/dystopian scenes (slate blue, teal, muted purple, off-white)
- Hot palette for chaotic/urgent scenes (vermillion, amber, charcoal, white)
- Slightly exaggerated proportions — heads 1.3x normal, expressive hands, rubbery limbs
- Characters have simple dot-eyes and minimal facial features, but MAXIMUM expressiveness through body language and posture
- Clean white or very light background — NO busy backgrounds, NO gradients
- Single-panel composition with strong visual hierarchy
- Thick panel border (2-3px black rule)

COMPOSITION PRINCIPLES:
- Rule of thirds for primary focal point placement
- Strong figure-ground contrast — subjects pop against the background
- Negative space is intentional and generous — let the cartoon breathe
- The eye should travel: primary gag → supporting detail → background easter egg
- Maximum 3 characters. Ideally 2 or fewer.
- Props and environment are minimal but specific — every object in frame serves the joke

RENDERING RULES:
- Do NOT include any text, words, letters, numbers, labels, captions, speech bubbles, or signage in the image
- No watermarks, signatures, or stamps
- The image must be a single panel
- Background is clean white or a single flat color wash
- No photorealistic rendering — this is a CARTOON with clear stylization
- Shadows are flat shapes (no soft gradients), used sparingly for depth
- Cross-hatching only for texture on specific materials (fabric, wood grain), never for shading
